 So that you can format your APEX SQL and PLSQL code here is a
 
 
 Chrome extension to inject plsql formatter module into pages hosting a Monaco code editor

 To use as a Chrome extension
 1. Clone or download (and unpack) this repository to local directory
 2. Go to Chrome -> Manage Extensions
 3. Turn on Developer Mode
 4. Click "Load Unpacked" button
 5. Navigate to the directory created in step 1
 6. Navigate to APEX page with code editor
